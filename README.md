# LUA Interface for XIMEA cameras #
This package provides an easy interface to get images from
a ximea camera. It's a very basic implementation. You can
open the camera in two modes (RGB24 or MONO8) and you can
grab a single image. Unfortunately the framerate is quite low
(Approx 12 frames per second)

You'll find in the examples directory a file that shows how to
use the interface
